Particle physics experiments are delivering significant results testing the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) and exploring its extensions. These studies have opened the path to even more exciting research in the upcoming years. The Higgs boson has been discovered, but its properties, still under investigation, could show discrepancies from the SM expectations. Hints to new physics, addressing the remaining open questions, can be found by performing precise SM measurements and exploring the broad set of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios, both in the context of specific models and effective field theory (EFT) frameworks. % FIXME -> focus on EFT!! and jets!! and VBS

Vector boson scattering (VBS) and vector boson fusion (VBF) processes can be studied at collider experiments as CMS. They are crucial to investigate the electroweak (EW) sector and are sensitive to new physics at energy scales beyond the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) direct reach through an EFT description of the SM. 

In the last years the LHC Physics Center has shown a significant interest to EFT. As a 2025 Junior Distinguished Researcher (DR) I would expand the program with a focus on VBS measurements and a complementary approach to the study of the Higgs properties.

My technical work is centered around the module production an qualification for the Outer Tracker Phase-2 upgrade. Fermilab is one of the US assembly and testing centers and will be in the module production phase next year. As a DR I will lead the training and coordination of the numerous students and postdocs that are expected to come to the LPR to test the several hundreds modules that will be produced.

\section{VBS measurements to probe EFT and expand the Higgs sector}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
VBS measurements probe the non-Abelian gauge structure of the electroweak interaction, which results in self-interactions between gauge bosons via triple and quartic gauge couplings. Potential variations in these couplings, due to physics beyond the standard model, could increase the cross-section of the VBS production of vector bosons at high energies, leading to observable changes in the high-energy distribution tails compared to SM expectations.

I am leading a search for anomalous electroweak production of WV bosons in association with two jets, in the case where the W boson decays leptonically and the V boson (either a W or a Z) decays hadronically.
The latest CMS result\footnote{CMS Collaboration, {\em Search for anomalous electroweak production of vector boson pairs in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV}, Physics Letters B, Volume 798, 2019, Article 134985, \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2019.134985}{doi:10.1016/j.physletb.2019.134985}} was obtained with 35.9~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in 2016. This search will now benefit from the full 138~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in the 2016--2018 data taking period, as well as improved calculations of the dimension-8 EFT operators.

Measurements in the VBS channel, combined with polarization studies of the vector bosons, are another way to probe not only the EW sector but also the Higgs one.
The measurement of the  W$^L_+$W$^L_+$ scattering cross-section is highly dependent on the HWW couplings\footnote{Michal Szleper, {\em The Higgs boson and the physics of WW scattering before and after Higgs discovery}, \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8367}{arXiv:1412.8367}} providing a complementary approach to determining these couplings. 

I am part of an LPC-based team, collaborating with a graduate student from the University of Virginia, aiming to study the polarization of two W bosons produced in association with two jets. This effort targets the semileptonic final state to take advantage of the high branching ratio of W $\to q\bar{q}$ decays and to explore polarization in jets, developing dedicated machine learning (ML) techniques. 

\vspace{\baselineskip}
 
The LPC has demonstrated a growing interest in Effective Field Theory (EFT) physics, and it has committed to organizing yearly workshops on the topic. The VBS and polarization research I am leading would significantly enhance the program, leveraging the extensive connections and expertise that the LPC offers.

The next workshop is scheduled to take place at Fermilab. With my previous experience on the LPC event committee and my active involvement in EFT activities, I am well-positioned to contribute to its successful execution.

A critical challenge for many analyses probing higher-dimension operators is the generation of samples that accurately account for different reweighting schemes. Drawing from the insights gained through my current efforts, I can provide valuable assistance to new analysts in navigating this complex and crucial process.

The study of polarization in jets stands to benefit from the LPC's keen interest in machine learning (ML) and its applications in jet tagging and anomaly detection. This intersection presents a stimulating opportunity to apply cutting-edge ML techniques to enhance our understanding of jet polarization.

\section{Module production and qualification for the Outer Tracker Phase-2 upgrade}
{\bf TODO} This part needs to be reviewed and better written.
%FIXME: here I need something to transition to the detector part

% FIXME -> update to OT, production etc.
In the next months, the CMS collaboration will enter a crucial stage of the detectors' developments for the HL - LHC. I am working on the Outer Tracker (OT) for the Phase-2 upgrade.
The design of the new tracker has been driven by the necessity to provide, for the first time in CMS, tracking information to the L1 trigger, allowing trigger rates to be kept at a sustainable level without sacrificing physics potential. For this, the OT will be made out of p$_{\mathrm{T}}$-modules with two closely spaced silicon sensors read out by front-end ASICs, which can correlate hits in the two sensors creating short track segments called ``stubs''. The modules come in two flavors: strip-strip (2S) and pixel-strip (PS), which contain different sensor configurations and multiple ASICs. 

Fermilab is an assembly and testing center for both module types. I am involved in the testing of the modules and in developing the qualification and grading procedures. Giving the delicate task the modules perform for the stub identification and the presence of multiple chips on every module, several calibration steps are foreseen to evaluate the noise performance and a proper communication among all components. 

About 5000 p$_{\mathrm{T}}$-modules (considering 2S and PS types) will be produced in the US across several institutes, and half of them at Fermilab. The pre-production is about to start and the production will be at full rate during the next DR mandate. This is a crucial period to train student and postdocs in testing the modules. It is expected that many of them will come to the LPC to help with the testing. With my experience I can prepare training material, instruct the future module testers from US institutes, and coordinate their efforts.

Creating expertise is crucial also to guarantee a smooth transition to the following integration, installation and operation phases.

\section{Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors R\&D}
{\bf TODO} This section needs to be checked carefully to mention the relevant contribution and scope.


Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are a highly promising technology with applications in vertex detection, tracking, and calorimetry. They offer extremely high granularity over large areas through stitching, combining low power density with cost-effectiveness. MAPS are notable for their minimal mass, crucial for precision in high-energy physics experiments.

Current developments focus on enhancing spatial resolution, timing, rate capabilities, and radiation hardness. These improvements ensure MAPS can handle fast, high-rate events and withstand harsh environments. Additionally, MAPS development is closely linked with advancements in ASICs, optimizing overall detector performance.

I recently became involved in the R\&D for this versatile detectors that could have a variety of applications in future collider experiments. A test setup is present in the Fermilab Silicon Detector facility and a collaboration of US and international institution is involved in the program (Fermialb, University of Florida, University of Padua). A testbeam in the Fermilab Test Beam Facility to probe the spatial resolution of three MAPS prototypes for the ALICE tracker upgrade is currently on going. 

Being a DR in 2025 would allow me take a leading role in the Fermilab contribution to the effort and expand its capabilities with the support of the LPC community.


 
\section{LPC activities}
\vspace{\baselineskip}
I have been a member of the LPC community since the beginning of my postdoc in November 2021.  Before that I have take advantage of the training offer and stimulating environment as a student.

%FIXME 
{\bf TODO}
Expand this section.



\section{Summary} 
\vspace{\baselineskip}
Both my analysis and technical work are crucially related to the activities on-going at Fermilab. As a DR I would benefit even more by the vibrating environment of the LPC  complementing the physics research already performed and supporting its training mission with a special dedication to the instrumentation sector.

I am involved in mentoring students of all levels, from high school to PhD, coming from different backgrounds and I am providing, for instance, tours of the SiDet,  the Silicon detector facility, for many programs at the lab. Through my experience and passion I hope to get minorities more involved in physics research and to provide them with useful insights and a welcoming environment to successfully pursue their interests.
