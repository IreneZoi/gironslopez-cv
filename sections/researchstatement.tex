Particle physics experiments are delivering significant results testing the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) and exploring its extensions. The next years are crucial to make sure we can continue addressing the remaining open questions in an effective way. As a Wilson Fellow I will ensure that we exploit the full potential of the upcoming HL-LHC era and design the next generation of collider experiments. This will be achieved by working on three main areas: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Observe Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) in semileptonic final states and measure polarization in jets
\item Deliver the Outer Tracker for the Phase-2 upgrade
\item Leverage Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) R\&D.
\end{itemize}

%to These studies have opened the path to even more exciting research in the upcoming years. The Higgs boson has been discovered, but its properties, still under investigation, could show discrepancies from the SM expectations. Hints to new physics, addressing the remaining open questions, can be found by performing precise SM measurements and exploring the broad set of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios, both in the context of specific models and effective field theory (EFT) frameworks. In parallel, the use of cutting-edge technology in the detectors and the need to always improve their performance has driven innovation with applications extending far beyond high-energy physics.
%
%My research is dedicated to the development of advanced detectors that enable unprecedented exploration of collider physics while fostering new applications across diverse domains. I am passionate about unraveling the complexities of the SM and its extensions through meticulous and innovative studies.

%\section{Investigating the Standard Model open questions}
%\vskip 5pt
%To address the open questions of the Standard Model, I have been both pursuing searches for particles predicted by promising BSM theories and tackling an EFT approach.
%
%Several theoretical models address the shortcomings of the SM predicting the existence of new particles with masses of the order of the TeV that can be produced at colliders. I developed a method that allows, with one single search, to probe many proposed extensions and can be further adapted to test even more exotic scenarios\footnote{CMS Collaboration, {\em Search for new heavy resonances decaying to WW, WZ, ZZ, WH, or ZH boson pairs in the all-jets final state in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV}, Phys. Lett. B 844 (2023) 137813, \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2023.137813}{doi.:10.1016/j.physletb.2023.137813}}. Moreover, the method’s flexibility permitted to perform the first combined search for heavy resonances decaying in hadronic WW, WZ, ZZ, WH and ZH final states. The bosons produced in the decay of these massive resonances have a high momentum. Thus, they decay into two collimated quarks, and the sprays of particles produced in the quarks' hadronization are merged into a single large radius jet. Therefore, jet substructure techniques are employed to identify jets originating from vector bosons or containing b-quark pairs from jets stemming from a single quark or gluon. Algorithms based on machine learning (ML) techniques are used to achieve the highest discriminating power. This study’s background estimation and signal extraction procedures rely on a multidimensional maximum likelihood fit to the masses of the jets originating from the bosons and their combined dijet system. The signal is resonant in the considered dimensions and a three-dimensional search for a bump on smoothly falling backgrounds is performed. A decorrelation method has been validated to prevent ML-based algorithms from introducing sculpting in the shape of the jet mass used as observable in the fit.

\section{VBS measurements to probe EFT and expand the Higgs sector}
\vskip 5pt
%Hints to new physics, addressing the remaining SM open questions, can be found by performing precise SM measurements and exploring the broad set of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios, both in the context of specific models and effective field theory (EFT) frameworks.
%Vector boson scattering (VBS) processes at collider experiments are crucial for investigating the electroweak (EW) sector. VBS is sensitive to new physics at energy scales beyond the direct reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), allowing researchers to probe potential deviations from the SM. VBS processes involve the self-interactions of gauge bosons through triple and quartic gauge couplings, central features of the SM's non-Abelian gauge structure. Changes in these couplings could lead to observable effects, such as increased cross-sections in high-energy VBS production, offering clues about BSM physics.

Hints of new physics can emerge from precise SM measurements and searches in Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios, both in specific models and effective field theory (EFT) frameworks. VBS processes are key to testing the electroweak (EW) sector and are sensitive to new physics at energy scales beyond the LHC’s direct reach. VBS probes gauge boson self-interactions via triple and quartic couplings. Deviations in these couplings could signal BSM physics, affecting VBS cross-sections at high energies. 

Moreover, it is still unknown whether the Higgs boson preserves unitarity of the longitudinal scattering amplitude at all energies. These processes have a small cross-section, and the HL-LHC era will provide the necessary data for a more detailed study. However, techniques to analyze W boson polarization in hadronic decays are still lacking and need to be developed.

\textbf{Current effort}
A recent CMS publication has measured evidence for the production of WV bosons in association with two jets, in the case where the W boson decays leptonically and the V boson (either a W or a Z) decays hadronically~\cite{[1]}. I am now leading a search for the anomalous electroweak production of such process. The latest CMS result~\cite{[2]} was obtained with 35.9~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in 2016. This search will now benefit from the full 138~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in the 2016--2018 data taking period, an improved statistical model, as well as more precise calculations of the dimension-8 EFT operators. %It is planned to publish a combined search of the WZ and ZV (where the Z decays leptonically) anomalous VBS production, in which the sensitivity to the EFT operators is driven by the WV channel. 

\textbf{Observation of VBS in the decay channel $\ell\nu$qq} With the availability of the full Run 2 and Run 3 statistics, the first observation for the VBS production of WV bosons in the semi-leptonic final states is within reach and with my experience in this channel I am well positioned to achieve it.

\textbf{Longitudinal scattering amplitude and polarization in boosted W $\to q\bar{q}$ \ jets}
Measurements in the VBS channel combined with polarization studies of the vector bosons are one of the main objectives of the precision LHC physics program as another way to probe not only the EW sector but also the Higgs one.
The measurement of the  W$^L_+$W$^L_+$ scattering cross-section is highly dependent on the HWW couplings~\cite{[3]} providing a complementary approach to determining these couplings.
I aim to study VBS processes in semileptonic final states, focusing on jet polarization. So far, polarization studies have been done only in fully leptonic channels, where new techniques have improved predictions for the HL-LHC. This analysis is challenging due to the small VBS cross-section, but the higher branching fraction of semileptonic decays increases the chances of measuring polarization before the HL-LHC or preparing for high-statistics studies there. As a Wilson Fellow I will lead this effort, overcoming the long standing challenges of reconstructing jets originating from transversely polarized W bosons~\cite{[4]}, and developing dedicated machine learning (ML) techniques to explore polarization in jets.
\textbf{This study stands to benefit from the Fermilab’s expertise in SM and EFT physics, jet substructure and ML}, expanding its applications in jet tagging and anomaly detection. This intersection presents a stimulating opportunity to apply cutting-edge ML techniques to enhance our understanding of the EW and Higgs sectors.

\section{Silicon detectors development}
\vskip 5pt
During my academic journey, I focused on silicon detector technologies, including planar and 3D pixel sensors, strip sensors, and monolithic sensors. My work included evaluating the radiation hardness and spatial resolution of small-pitch pixel sensors, a cornerstone of the CMS Phase-2 Inner Tracker upgrade. Currently, I am deeply involved with the CMS Outer Tracker  (OT) Phase-2 upgrade and engaged with the R\&D of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS), which could play a key role in future collider experiments.
\vskip 5pt 
\subsection{Outer Tracker Phase-2 upgrade}
\vskip 5pt 
In the coming months, the CMS collaboration will enter a critical phase of detector developments for the HL-LHC. I am actively involved in the Outer Tracker (OT) upgrade for Phase-2~\cite{[5]}. This new tracker is designed to provide, for the first time at a hadron collider, tracking information to the Level-1 (L1) trigger, enabling sustainable trigger rates without sacrificing physics potential. The OT will be composed of p$_{\mathrm{T}}$-modules, which provide a rough transverse momentum measurement to the L1 trigger. These modules consist of two closely spaced silicon sensors read out by front-end ASICs, which correlate hits in the sensors to create short track segments known as ``stubs.'' The modules come in two types: strip-strip (2S) and pixel-strip (PS), each with distinct sensor configurations and multiple ASICs.

\textbf{Current effort}
I am deeply involved in the testing of both modules types and in developing calibrations and quality assurance procedures. I played an essential role in validating and improving the performance of PS modules, ensuring their readiness for the LHC upgrade. I led successful testbeam campaigns to test PS module performance, to verify the stub identification procedure and to compare the performance of non-irradiated and irradiated sensors. As member of a dedicated task force, I solved outstanding issues with PS modules, achieving stable operation at the working temperature of -35$^{\circ}$C and correct stubs readout for all module flavors, including the first observation of stubs with the fastest readout PS modules.  

\textbf{Building the Outer Tracker}
The Silicon Detector facility (SiDet) at Fermilab serves as an assembly and testing center for both module types. Extensive production of thousands of modules is starting, continuing in 2026. After that, detector integration and commissioning activities will rump up. I have been working extensively in developing testing procedures and preparing the facility for these stages. As a Wilson Fellow I will be able to lead the testing activities at SiDet during production and ensure the best performing modules are selected for the detector. I will then use my knowledge to ensure a smooth commissioning and data taking of the future detector.
\textbf{I have a decade long experience on the Phase-2 upgrade of the CMS tracking detectors, as Wilson Fellow I will have the unique opportunity to see my efforts come together in the new detector.}

\subsection{Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors R\&D}
\vskip 5pt
Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are a highly promising technology with vertex detection, tracking, and calorimetry applications. They offer extremely high granularity over large areas through stitching, combining low power density with cost-effectiveness. MAPS are notable for their minimal mass, crucial for precision in high-energy physics experiments.
Current developments focus on enhancing spatial resolution, timing, rate capabilities, and radiation hardness. Additionally, MAPS development is closely linked with advancements in ASICs, optimizing overall detector performance through co-design procedures.

\textbf{Current effort}
I recently became involved in the R\&D for these versatile detectors that could have a variety of applications in future collider experiments. The studies focus on the ARCADIA prototype~\cite{[6]}, featuring a patterned backside to achieve uniform full depletion over thicknesses of few hundreds microns. The activities involve support for a recent testbeam to assess the performance of three MAPS prototypes for the ALICE tracker upgrade that took place in the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. Moreover, a test setup is present at Fermilab that features a laser for charge collection studies.

\textbf{New MAPS for future experiments}
Fermilab is working to secure a contract with SkyWater for a U.S.-based MAPS foundry, presenting an exciting opportunity to advance the semiconductor sector and strengthen domestic capabilities in detector technology. However, to have a cost-effective and efficient devices production, the development of a robust simulation setup for design optimization is essential. This could involve the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to allow leverage insights from previous development attempts by our international collaborators. %In this We cannot use trial and error approach as CERN because it is too expensive. We need to have a solid model of the wafer we want. Possible improvements to current design are a thicker epilayer to have a higher gain and so better timing. We need simulation 
%We could integrate AI in the simulation to factor in the learning curve from CERN 
At Fermilab, {\bf I can bring my expertise in silicon detector R\&D} to this effort, contributing to the design and optimization of next-generation MAPS sensors. Collaborating with the laboratory {\bf microelectronics group and AI experts}—key assets in this initiative—will ensure a strong foundation for cutting-edge advancements. Additionally, \textbf{the newly formed Collider Physics Division at Fermilab provides the ideal environment to shape detector designs for future collider experiments, bridging technological development with the needs of next-generation physics discoveries.}
