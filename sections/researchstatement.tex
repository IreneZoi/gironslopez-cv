Particle physics experiments are delivering significant results testing the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) and exploring its extensions. These studies have opened the path to even more exciting research in the upcoming years. The Higgs boson has been discovered, but its properties, still under investigation, could show discrepancies from the SM expectations. Neutrino masses are yet to be measured, their hierarchy has to be established, and observed anomalies need to be clarified. Hints to new physics, addressing the remaining open questions, can be found by performing precise SM measurements and exploring the broad set of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios, both in the context of specific models and effective field theory (EFT) frameworks. % FIXME -> focus on EFT!! and jets!! and VBS

Vector boson scattering (VBS) and vector boson fusion (VBF) processes can be studied at collider experiments as CMS. They are crucial to investigate the electroweak (EW) sector and are sensitive to new physics at energy scales beyond the LHC direct reach through an EFT description of the SM.

VBS measurements probe the non-Abelian gauge structure of the electroweak interaction, which leads to self-interactions between gauge bosons via triple and quartic gauge couplings. Potential variations of these couplings, due to physics beyond the standard model, could increase the cross section of the VBS production of vector bosons at high energies, producing changes in the tail of high-energy distributions, with respect to the SM expectation.

I am leading a search for anomalous electroweak production of WV bosons in association with two jets, in the case where the W boson decays leptonically and the V (either a W or a Z) decays hadronically.
The latest CMS result\footnote{CMS Collaboration, {\em Search for anomalous electroweak production of vector boson pairs in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV}, Physics Letters B, Volume 798, 2019, Article 134985, \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2019.134985}{doi:10.1016/j.physletb.2019.134985}} was obtained with 35.9~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in 2016. The search will now benefit from the full 138~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in the 2016--2018 data taking period and improved calculations of the dimension-8 EFT operators.

Measurements in the VBS channel combined with polarization studies of the vector bosons are another way to probe not only the EW sector but also the Higgs one.
The measurement of the  W$^L_+$W$^L_+$ scattering cross section highly depends on the HWW couplings\footnote{Michal Szleper, {\em The Higgs boson and the physics of WW scattering before and after Higgs discovery}, \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8367}{arXiv:1412.8367}} providing a complementary approach to the determination of the couplings. 

I am part of an LPC based team that together with a graduate student from the University of Virginia is aiming at studying the polarization of two W bosons produced in association with two jets. The effort targets the semileptonic final state to take advantage of the high branching ratio of the W $\to q\bar{q}$ and to explore polarization in jets, developing dedicated machine learning (ML) techniques.

The LPC has shown an increased interest in EFT physics and the determination of organizing yearly workshops on the topic. The VBS and polarization research presented above would expand the offered program and would benefit from the connections and expertise the LPC provides.

The next workshop is already planned to take place again at Fermilab. With my previous experience in the LPC event committee and my involvement in EFT activities I would contribute to a successful realization. 

A critical challenge for many analyses probing higher dimension operators is the sample generation taking into account the different reweighing weights. With the knowledge gained from my current effort I could assist new analysts in this delicate and crucial step to develop a new study.

The study of polarization in jets would benefit from the LPC interest in ML and its applications for jet tagging or anomaly detection bringing a stimulating application.

%FIXME: here I need something to transition to the detector part
\vspace{\baselineskip}
% FIXME -> update to OT, production etc.
In the next years, the CMS collaboration will enter a crucial phase of the detectors' developments for the HL - LHC.  It would be extremely stimulating and exciting to bring my input to these relevant projects and contribute to the new detectors' construction. Having followed the pixel Phase-2 upgrade closely by test beam campaigns and dedicated studies, I realized how crucial it is to thoroughly test all the new components. Furthermore, it is important to integrate into the simulation studies for the HL - LHC the promising sensors and elements currently under test to verify that the detector design fulfills the requirements and delivers the expected physics results. Also, understanding and simulating the radiation damage at the demanding HL-LHC fluences represents a challenging and necessary topic to address.

% FIXME-> focus on the LPC, summarize the proposed programs
Finally, working in collaboration with the Fermilab group will allow me to closely follow the new detector's commissioning, operation, and monitoring to gain the relevant expertise to ensure excellent data quality and physics performance in the promising future upgrade and to play a significant role in the progression of our knowledge with groundbreaking research.
